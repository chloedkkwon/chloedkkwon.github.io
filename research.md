    description: Tensification refers to the phonological process of a plain obstruent becoming tense, which are two distinct consonants in Korean. I'm investigating whether this is deriving a general marker of Korean compounds. Predicting the occurrence of compound tensification is challenging since there are multiple factors contributing to it. What is more interesting is that the native speakers seem to show inconsistent perceptual judgement for distinguishing plain and tense consonants occurring in compounds despite the fact that these sounds are phonologically distinct. By questioning the fundamental characteristics of these consonants, I hope to shed a light on how they are represented in terms of production and perception and ultimately model it so that the computers can replicate a similar process. 

  - title: The prosodic patterns in English production by Native speakers and Korean speakers of English

    description: I examined prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shapes the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 in a systematic way.
