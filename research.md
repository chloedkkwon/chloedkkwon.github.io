    description: This is my dissertation project studying a morpho-phonological process in Korean called  'sai-sios', or compound tensification. This process causes a plain obstruent in the initial position of the second noun in a noun + noun compound to become tense. I'm asking questions like, how is compound tensification manifested in actual speech? And, as described in the traditional literature, can we say there is a categorical distinction between tense stops derived from compound tensification and underlying plain tense stops? What Iâ€™m also interested in looking at are variations across speakers and lexical items, so that I can better understand what parts of the phonetic patterns arise from speaker-individual tendencies and lexicalization and how they are tied to the phonological grammar.

    description: I looked at prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for Korean L2 speakers, mainly due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shape the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 systematically.
