    description: I examined prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shapes the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 in a systematic way.
