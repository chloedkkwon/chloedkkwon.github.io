    description: Tensification refers to a phonological process in which a plain obstruent becomes tense. I'm investigating whether or not it is in the process of becoming a general marker of Korean compounds. Predicting the occurrence of compound tensification is difficult since there are multiple factors that contribute to it. What complicates the picture more is that speakers seem to show instances of a sound change where broader types of compounds occur with tensification. By delving in to this complex problem, I hope to provide a deeper understanding of what compound words are, how they are represented, and how their features surface.

  - title: The prosodic patterns in English production by Native speakers and Korean speakers of English

    description: I examined prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shapes the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 in a systematic way.
