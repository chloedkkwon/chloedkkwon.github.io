    description: Tensification in Korean refers to the phonological process of a plain obstruent becoming tense, which are two distinct consonants. This process takes place in several environments, but the one I'm interested in is when two nouns form a compound. This specific instance of tensification is also known as compound tensificaiton or sai-sios. I'm investigating the phonetic characteristics of tense consonants derived from sai-sios, performing in-depth analysis including individual speaker and word-by-word variations, in hopes of better understanding the representation of sound categories. 


  - title: The prosodic patterns in English production by Native speakers and Korean speakers of English

    description: I examined prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for the Korean L2 speakers, mainly due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shapes the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 in a systematic way.
