    description: This is my dissertation project studying a morpho-phonological process in Korean called  'sai-sios', or compound tensification. This process causes a plain obstruent in the initial position of the second noun in a noun + noun compound to become tense. Compound tensification is interesting since it's not fully predictable when it will occur and what happens to the pronunciations when it does. While previous studies have looked at possible contributing factors, like frequency and the word origins, using mainly dictionaries and survey responses, I look at actual pronunciations with data from a corpus and a production experiment. I'm asking questions like, how is compound tensification manifested in actual speech? And, as described in the traditional literature, can we say there is a categorical distinction between tense stops derived from compound tensification and underlying plain tense stops? So far, I have results from the corpus study, which show that morphological context, whether the stops are in simplex nouns or compounds, makes a difference in the phonetic realizations in the direction that the contrast between plain and tense stops seems to be neutralized in compounds. But because of the sparsity issue in the corpus data, I’m currently investigating this further in a more controlled production experiment to see if we observe a similar pattern or something different. What I’m also interested in looking at are variations across speakers and lexical items, so that I can better understand what parts of the phonetic patterns arise from speaker-individual tendencies and lexicalization and how they are tied to the phonological grammar.


  - title: The prosodic patterns in English production by Native speakers and Korean speakers of English

    description: I looked at prosodic patterns exhibited by Korean L2 speakers of English compared to those of native speakers. Since English and Korean are prosodically distinct languages, I expected unique patterns to arise for Korean L2 speakers, mainly due to L1 interference. Specifically, I hypothesized that the difference would stem from phrase edges being more prominent in Korean. This hypothesis is supported by the result that shows that L2 speakers are more consistently affected by boundary effects. It further shows that specific prosodic characteristics of L1 shape the realization of L2 speech, which helps us understand why L2 speech sounds distinct from L1 systematically.
