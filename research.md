    description: This dissertation project investigates the phonetic realization of compound tensification (a.k.a. sai-sios), a morphophonological process in Korean. It refers to when a plain obstruent in the initial position of the second noun surfaces a tense obstruent in a noun+noun compound. This phenomenon is interesting due to its unpredictable occurrence and the variability it introduces in pronunciation. In my project, I focus on the phonetic realization of tense stops that emerge from compound tensification and their mapping to listeners' perceptions. 
### (a) Corpus study: Using corpus data, I explored how compound tensification manifests in natural speech and whether the tense stops resulting from it are categorically distinct from both underlying plain and tense stops, as assumed in traditional analyses. When characterized by stop duration, F0 onset and H1-H2 on the following vowel, derived tense stops in compounds exhibited characteristics expected for underlying tense stops (i.e., longer duration, higher F0 onset, lower H1-H2), whereas underlying tense stops in compounds exhibited characteristics expected for underlying plain stops (i.e., shorter duration, lower F0 onset, lower H1-H2). The results call into question whether compound tensification results in categorically distinctive tense consonants.

    (b) Production study: One notable factor that contributes to the occurrence of tensification is the preceding sound. Specifically, if the target medial stop is preceded by a sonorant, tenficiation is much more likely to happen than when the stop is preceded by a vowel. To

    description: I examined the prosodic patterns of Korean L2 English speakers compared to English L1 speakers. Given the prosodic differences between Korean and English, I anticipated that unique patterns in L2 speech would emerge due to L1 influence. Specifically, I hypothesized that Korean L2 speakers would exhibit stronger boundary effects, reflecting the prominence of phrase edges in Korean prosody. This hypothesis was supported by findings showing that L2 speakers are more consistently influenced by boundary effects, suggesting that specific prosodic features of L1 shape L2 speech production. These insights contribute to our understanding of why L2 speech systematically differs from L1 speech.
