<p>
    Welcome! My name is Chloe, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell. 
</p>

<p>
    My research interests lie in phonetics, phonology, and their interface. I'm also  interested in exploring research methodologies and computational modeling of linguistic data. For my dissertation, I'm examining the phonetic patterns of Korean stops in compounds to shed light on the nature of phonemic contrasts in less robust contexts and the underlying mechanisms involved in the link between speech production and perception. 
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work, I love to watch horror movies, visit breweries and wineries, and cuddle with my precious cat, Nuri.
