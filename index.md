<p>
    Welcome! My name is Chloe, and I'm a fourth year PhD student in linguistics at Cornell. 
</p>

<p>
    My research interests lie in phonetics, phonology, and their interface with other subareas involved in understanding the production-perception interaction and prosody. I'm also very interested in exploring various research methodologies and computational modeling of linguistic data. 
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work, I love to explore nature and spend much time cuddling with my cat, Nuri.
